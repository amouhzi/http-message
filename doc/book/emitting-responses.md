# Emitting responses

If you are using a non-SAPI PHP implementation and wish to use the `Server` class, or if you do not
want to use the `Server` implementation but want to emit a response, this package provides an
interface, `HttpMessage\Response\EmitterInterface`, defining a method `emit()` for emitting the
response. A single implementation is currently available, `HttpMessage\Response\SapiEmitter`,
which will use the native PHP functions `header()` and `echo` in order to emit the response. If you
are using a non-SAPI implementation, you will need to create your own `EmitterInterface`
implementation.
